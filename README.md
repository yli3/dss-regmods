## Introduction
This was my course project for the September 2015 iteration of the Regression Modeling class (regmods-32) from the JHU DSS Coursera series. In this assignment, we perform some amateur regression analysis on R's sample `mtcars` dataset and present a mock executive summary and briefing report on our results.
